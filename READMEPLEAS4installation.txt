run program once to create a magical folder thingy "its not a bug its a feature"
run the getPythonInstaller .bat file to get the installer 
unzip it from your downloads 
run python installer in the custom mode
	make sure you install pip
	add it to the path
then run .bat file
program should work hopefully
